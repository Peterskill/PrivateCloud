# PrivateCloud
This is my memoir with codes which I used to create my own cloud

After I do job i will commit and tell what I wanted to achive and what I did to do that perticualr task sometimes it might take days for me to upload but I'm using this to help people on what I'm doing


# Introduction
***You would ask why I'm doing this?*** 
*I'm doing this for fun and i want to learn something*

So if I'm going to do a cloud system first I need a plan 

# Planing phase
First I needed a system i got a system with these *Specifictaion*

> 

 - AMD 5 5600G
 - 32GB RAM
 - 4 storages(1 SDD(128GB boot device) & 3 OLD HDD)
 
 Now that I decieded on the stuff i need i stated to wonder why am Igoing to create this cloud?
 

> 

 - Private Cloud Storage
 - A home lab
 - Entertainment server
 
 Now you Might think You can do all this with ***Truenas*** but I wanted to see how to do from the down up so i wanted to take a hard road so that I can learn all the work you need ed to do from bottom up so I chose differpath
 

> Use
> 

 - Openstack
 - Kuberntes and Docker on Opentack
 
 Now That you know what I'm going to do go through each folder of my repo to see what I did for each task
